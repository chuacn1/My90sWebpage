<h2>Why did i attain my Diploma first and then my O Levels?</h2>
<p>I attained my diploma first and then my O Levels because I messed up my N Levels. I thought I could head to PFP and get good grades. 
        Well, technically, I did get good grades, but I did not meet the requirement of getting a good E-grade for English. 
        I was embarrassed and tried to make it up by going for private schooling. 
        However, I soon realized that I wasn’t really into sports science. After that, I thought of taking a step back and doing my O Levels so I could pursue a degree.
         And now, here I am, doing my Bachelor’s in IT at Otago Polytechnic.</p>
